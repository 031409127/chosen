### Using CoffeeScript & Cake

First, make sure you have the proper CoffeeScript / Cake set-up in place. We have added a package.json that makes this easy:

```
npm install -d
```

This will install `coffee-script` and `uglifyjs`.

Once you're configured, building the JavasScript from the command line is easy:

    cake build                # build Chosen from source
    cake watch                # watch coffee/ for changes and build Chosen
    
If you're interested, you can find the recipes in Cakefile.
